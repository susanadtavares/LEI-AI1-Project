# 🧳**Portugal Tourism Platform**

Tourism is one of the pillars of the Portuguese economy, driven by the country’s cultural, historical, and natural diversity, which attracts millions of visitors every year. In this context, Plobe was created — a digital platform designed to simplify and enrich travellers' experiences by showcasing iconic destinations in Portugal and sharing their historical background.

The name “Plobe” combines Portugal and globe, symbolizing the breadth, richness, and diversity of the country.

The platform was developed to meet the needs of tourists seeking clear, reliable, and accessible information. With a responsive and intuitive design, and built using modern technologies, Plobe aims to be a valuable tool for anyone looking to explore Portugal in a more informed way.
